# 🧠 Job Title Prediction using NLP

This project builds a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to predict job titles based on job description text.

The problem is formulated as a supervised multi-class classification task using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a job description, the goal is to predict the corresponding job title.

This helps automate resume screening, job classification, and recruitment analytics.

## 📊 Model Selection

After comparing multiple modeling approaches:

- Classical ML models performed strong for structured job description data.
- Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features provided stable and interpretable performance.
- Deep learning and transformer models were explored for performance comparison and architectural understanding.

The final selected approach balances performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
